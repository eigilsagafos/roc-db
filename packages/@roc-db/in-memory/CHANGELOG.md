- [#14](https://github.com/eigilsagafos/roc-db/pull/14)
  [`50b2092`](https://github.com/eigilsagafos/roc-db/commit/50b2092eaa6bd1f26b0eec8d81131471dcb0e40b)
  Thanks [@eigilsagafos](https://github.com/eigilsagafos)! - Type-check the
  whole monorepo and ship correct type declarations.

    Every package now type-checks with zero errors and no longer builds its
    `.d.ts` with `tsc --noCheck`, so the published declarations are actually
    verified. CI gains a repo-wide `typecheck` gate.

    Consumer-facing type fixes in `@roc-db/valdres`'s `createValdresAdapter`:
    the `AtomFamily` params had swapped `<Value, Args>` generics and non-tuple
    `Args` (which silently degraded to `any`);
    `entityAtom`/`mutationAtom`/`entityUniqueAtom`/ `entityIndexAtom` now have
    correct value-first/args-second generics matching runtime. `roc-db` also
    exports the document type as `EntityDocument`, tightens `Mutation`
    (`identityRef`/`sessionRef`/`persistedAt`/`appliedAt`), and makes
    `readOperation` accept an `outputSchema` setting (symmetric with
    `writeOperation`).

    Runtime bug fixes surfaced by the type-checking:

    - `WriteTransaction.redo` was never wired as an instance method (unlike
      `undo`), so the `redo` operation threw at runtime — now wired.
    - `patchEntity` removed **all** refs from an index array on update (a
      `ref !== ref` self-comparison) instead of just the patched entity's ref.
